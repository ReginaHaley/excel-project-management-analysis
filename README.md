# Excel Project Management Data Analysis

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize departmental project distributions using Excel tools, including PivotTables and pie charts.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset includes 46 projects across 15 departments such as Operations, Marketing, Research, and Support. Using Excel, I created:

- A **PivotTable** to summarize the number of projects per department
- A **Pie Chart** to visually represent how projects are distributed across departments
